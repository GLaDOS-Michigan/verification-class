lemma CheeseTakeTwo()
{
  // So here's the "statement" version of a forall expression.
  // With nothing in the body, it's exactly equivalent to the assertion
  // above.
  forall o1:Order
    // The assumptions follow a '|' ("such that")
    | o1.Appetizer?
    // The conclusions follow a "requires" keyword.

  {
    // The body of the forall statement is a proof context for the
    // statement's conclusion. Inside here, o1 is defined, and we
    // can use it to complete the proof.

    // But how? What's missing is that Dafny needs a "witness" to the
    // there-exists. We need to show an expression that satisfies the
    // body of the exists. Try uncommenting these lines:
    /*{*////*}*/    var o3 := Sandwich(Ham, o1.cheese);
    /*{*////*}*/    assert o3.Sandwich? && o1.cheese == o3.cheese;
    // Simply *mentioning* an Order that satisfies the predicate
    // on o2 above is enough for Dafny to see the proof; once we mention
    // it, Dafny will try plugging it into the expression. Try removing
    // the assertion above this comment; notice that the proof still goes
    // through.
