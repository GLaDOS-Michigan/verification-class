//#title Single-Server Lock Service Proof
//#desc A more realistic invariant proof of the previous chapter's lock
//#desc service.

// We provide a correct spec for the lock server here, but leave you
// to define the Safety property to be proven.
// You are welcome to prove correct your own model from chapter03,
// but note that may be too hard or too easy if your spec is broken.

// Copy your solution for chapter03/exercise03 into the current directory with
// this name:
include "chapter03-exercise03.dfy"
//#extract ../../chapter03-state-machines/exercises/exercise03.template solution chapter03-exercise03.dfy
