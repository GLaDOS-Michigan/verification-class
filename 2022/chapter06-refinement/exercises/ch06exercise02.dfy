//#title Property Lemmas for Atomic Commit
//#desc The state machine model captures AC2 nicely,
//#desc but let's make it very clear that the model also obeys
//#desc AC1, AC3 and AC4.

// To increase our confidence that our state machine spec from
// exercise02 accurately defines our goal,
// we can state and prove some properties about it.
//
// AC1: All processes that reach a decision reach the same one.
// AC3: The Commit decision can only be reached if all processes prefer Yes.
// AC4: If all processes prefer Yes, then the decision must be Commit.
//
// We'll not bother with AC2 because it can't be stated as a safety
// property, however it should be abundantly clear from the Next
// action of the state machine model.
// AC2: (stability) A process cannot reverse its decision after it has reached one.
//
// We'll not bother with AC5 because it's a liveness property, which
// is outside the scope of this course.
// AC5: (liveness) All processes eventually decide.
//
// If you wrote a broken spec, it will be difficult to prove these properties
// on it.
